# üìöDevelopment Books 

This simple coding kata is designed to be solved using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.

A publisher offers a series of **five books on software development**, loved by developers who strive to sharpen their craft. To encourage readers to buy more, the publisher offers **discounts for purchasing multiple different titles**.

The goal is to implement a system that calculates the total price of any basket of books according to the discount rules.

## Book List

Each book costs **50 EUR** when bought individually. The available books are:

1. *Clean Code* (Robert Martin, 2008)
2. *The Clean Coder* (Robert Martin, 2011)
3. *Clean Architecture* (Robert Martin, 2017)
4. *Test Driven Development by Example* (Kent Beck, 2003)
5. *Working Effectively with Legacy Code* (Michael C. Feathers, 2004)

##  Discount Rules

- 1 unique book: **No discount**
- 2 unique books: **5% discount**
- 3 unique books: **10% discount**
- 4 unique books: **20% discount**
- 5 unique books: **25% discount**

üìù **Note:**
If the basket contains multiple copies of some books, the discounts only apply to the **unique** books within each set. The goal is to organize books into sets that maximize the overall discount.

Each commit messages contains **Title**. The title consists of the type of the message and subject. `type: Subject`

#### Commit Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Changes to documentation
- **style**: Code formatting changes (e.g., fixing indentation, removing spaces, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without affecting functionality
- **test**: Adding or refactoring tests
- **chore**: Updates to build processes or auxiliary tools (e.g., package manager configs)

## How to Build the Application

- Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/2025-CCE-E-DEV-006/DevelopmentBooks
- Build the project and run the tests by running
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
- The **Model Classes** used in the project are generated from the **OpenAPI** specification during the build process. Running `mvn clean install` will regenerate the models as part of the build.
